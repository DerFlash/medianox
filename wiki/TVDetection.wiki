#summary Describes the function of the TV Detection Settings

= Introduction =

MediaNox provides a mechanism to detect a tv show by looking at the file name.<br>
Once one of these _tests_ matches a filename it can also use some parts of the filename as information for this tv show (like name, season, episode, ...).

The format of this _test_ is pretty easy.
Every line in this table contains a _test_ - so every filename added to the queue would be checked agains every row until one of the tests succeeds. Otherwise the file is handled as a *movie*...

The *left column* of the table lists the [http://regexkit.sourceforge.net/Documentation/pcre/pcrepattern.html regular expression] which is used to check/match the filename.
This regex can (or should) also search for some subpatterns(the parentheses).

At this point the *right column* comes into play:
Every argument (separated by commas) in this cell stands for one of the detected sub matches and is used as a tv show info:
  * n - name
  * s - season number
  * e - episode number
  * d - description
